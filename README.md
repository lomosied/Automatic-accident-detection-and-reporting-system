The purpose of this project is to detect when an accident occurs and report it to the relevant emergency services. The project was built on a scaled size but can be fitted on lofe sized vehicles. 
The project detects impact accidents using impact sensors placed at the front of the vehicle, rear side, left and right sides. It also detects rollover accidents using accelerometer and gyroscope fitted on the vehicle.
In the event of an accident, the system cuts off all electrical power to the vehicle and contacts emergency services via text and/call. after which it uploads the accident data to an online databasefor future analysis 
The system runs on an Arduino Mega microcontroller, mpu6050, sim800l, Esp8266 NodeMcu, Neo-6M gps module, and pressure sensors.
